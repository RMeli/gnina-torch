## Installation

The `gninatorch` Python package has several dependencies, including:

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [PyTorch-Ignite](https://pytorch.org/ignite/)
* [libmolgrid](https://gnina.github.io/libmolgrid/)

A full developement environment can be installed using the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager and the provided [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment file (`devtools/conda-envs/gninatorch.yaml`):

```bash
conda env create -f devtools/conda-envs/gninatorch.yaml
conda activate gninatorch
```

Once the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment is created and activated, the `gninatorch` package can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) as follows:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

### Tests

In order to check the installation, unit tests are provided and can be run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):

```bash
pytest --cov=gninatorch
```

## Usage

Training and inference modules try to follow the original [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) implementation of [gnina/scripts](https://github.com/gnina/scripts), however not all features are implemented.

The folder `examples` includes some complete examples for training and inference.

The folder `gninatorch/weights` contains pre-trained models from [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina), converted from Caffe to PyTorch.

### Pre-trained GNINA models

Pre-trained GNINA models can be loaded as follows:

```python
from gninatorch.gnina import load_gnina_model

model = load_gnina_model(MODEL_NAME)
```

Pre-trainde GNINA models can be loades as an ensemble as follows:

```python
from gninatorch.gnina import load_gnina_models

model_ensemble = load_gnina_models([MODEL_NAME_1, MODEL_NAME_2, ...])
```

A single model will return `log_CNNscore` and `CNNaffinity`, while an ensemble of models will return `log_CNNscore`, `CNNaffinity`, and `CNNvariance`.

Inference with pre-trained [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina) models (`--cnn` argument in [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina)) is implemented in the `gnina` module:

```bash
python -m gninatorch.gnina --help
```

### Training

Training is implemented in the `training` module:

```bash
python -m gninatorch.training --help
```

### Inference

Inference is implemented in the `inference` module:

```bash
python -m gninatorch.inference --help
```
